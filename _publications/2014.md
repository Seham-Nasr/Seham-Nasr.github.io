# Abstract
Breast Cancer is among the top five causes of cancer death and the topmost cause among women worldwide. representing 16% of all female cancers[3]. breast cancer is diagnosed in 1 in 8 women[3]. Worldwide, it is estimated that more than 1.5 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year, and $2.4B was spent on breast cancer screening in 2009[3].The Multifrequency Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)early diagnosis through simple, non-invasive and inexpensive screening can provide great deal of aids. In our project we are focusing on the design and construction of the device ,Working with software which installed on computer connected with that device, we use an Arduino UNO board with built-in microcontroller of (ATmega328p). It based EIS system has been designed and implemented using function generator (LM5401), Howland V/I design by different value of resistors, and Amplifiers, electrodes; Electrical impedance scanning (EIS) maps are a measure of the electrical properties of an object made through surface measurements through automatic switching system using microcontroller, Instrumentation amplifier and Butterworth bandpass filter. On other hand our software focusing on the generated signal from the electric circuit and then processes it to specifics if there is any abnormal state or existing tumor on breast according to the changes of measured electrical bioimpedance.

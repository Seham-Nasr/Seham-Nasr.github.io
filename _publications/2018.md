# Abstract
Breast cancer is an insidious disease that may be present and may be developed over many years with out signs or symptoms of any kind. Our aim in this paper is to design a system using Multi-frequency Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) to detect early breast cancer through simple, non-invasive and inexpensive requirement which can provide great deal of aids. In our proposed system, we are focusing on the design and construction of the device which consist of current source, bio-impedance measurement switching and Instrumentation with butter worth band-pass filtering, an Arduino UNO board with built-in microcontroller has been used for switching electrodes in EIS system. On other hand our software focusing on the generated signal from the electric circuit and then processes it to specify if there is any abnormal impedance values that implies existing tumor on breast tissue according to the changes of measured electrical bio-impedance.

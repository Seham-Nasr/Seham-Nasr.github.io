# Abstract
Breast cancer is an insidious disease that may be present and may develop over many years without signs or symptoms of any kind. Our aim in this paper is to design a system using Multi-frequency Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) to detect early breast cancer through simple, non-invasive, and inexpensive requirements that can provide great aid. In our proposed system, we are focusing on the design and construction of the device which consists of the current source, bio-impedance measurement switching, and Instrumentation with butter worth band-pass filtering, an Arduino UNO board with built-in microcontroller has been used for switching electrodes in EIS system. On the other hand, our software focuses on the signal generated by the electric circuit. Then it processes it to specify if any abnormal impedance values imply existing tumors on breast tissue according to the changes of measured electrical bio-impedance.

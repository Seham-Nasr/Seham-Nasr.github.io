# Abstract
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have become one of
the most common techniques in different applications such as
agriculture, factory monitoring, health care, and fire tracking. WSN
has many advantages such as low cost, small size,
multifunctional, self-organized, and able to be routed by WSN
protocols. On the other hand, WSN has some backward that
obstruct some applications such as a low battery, short lifetime,
area of sensor deployed, and sensor energy consumption. In this
paper, we propose a new approach to achieve better
enhancement of WSN in terms of network lifetime and data
transmission time represented by reducing the packet delay time.
Then, we compare the simulated result of the proposed algorithm
with the basic LEACH protocol with fixing parameters. The
proposed algorithm achieved a 128.80% improvement compared
with the basic LEACH in the concept of network lifetime

Hey, I'm **Seham Nasr**! I am a data science researcher, and a **PhD candidate** at the Center for Cognitive Interaction Technology (CITEC)- Bielefeld University, Germany.

My research interest is to build an Explainable AI system to improve transparency, trustworthiness, and understandability.

Here I share my projects, tutorials, art, and whatever else I feel like putting out there. You'll find my notes and a collection of technical articles I've written over the years. Visit the projects page to explore highlights of my open-source contributions.
